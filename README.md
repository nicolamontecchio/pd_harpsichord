The `sampleplayer~` external can be found at [this github
page](https://github.com/nicolamontecchio/pd_sampleplayer).  Clone it
inside this directory (git submodules do not work on edison
apparently).

Harpsichord samples are available from [Soni
Musicae](http://duphly.free.fr/en/blanchet.html).

The `samples_prepare.py` script must be run to rename wave files,
since spaces are hard to deal with in Pd.
